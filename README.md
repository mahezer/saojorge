# S達o Jorge

S達o Jorge is a CLI helper for people that don't use a lot of Git, but need it from time to time.

## Installation

Clone the repository and put it in your PATH variable.

## Usage

Run `saojorge` and answer it's questions.

Think of `saojorge` as a simplified version of Git.

## Why S達o Jorge

S達o Jorge is the Catholic soldier saint, which is commonly depicted killing a dragon.

With this CLI, my goal was to "kill" the hard times people that don't use Git often have.

## ToDo

Currently, `saojorge` is in Portuguese only. Please feel free to i18n it.

## Contribution

PRs are welcome! :)
